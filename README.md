# Pool Table simulator

I made this simulator using Claude integrated with aider, an AI code assistant that works from the terminal. Cost me $0.75 in Anthropic credits to get this far. It was able to make something that *looks* like pool, but it struggled with the actual physics and its kinda crappy. Don't think AI can take our jobs yet.
